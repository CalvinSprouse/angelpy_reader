       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">tags onto Yiven’s desk. The prime glared back at the younger man, but\\nsaid nothing. “It was something out of the </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">It was something\\nelse, prime. It could shroud. Not just from sight – it could hide its\\nthermals, too. We had to </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">where they were. “However, given the casualties all our forces are\\nsuffering, I think it is presumptuous to assume</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">the\\nliving tide, at last breaking through into empty hallways. Tables had been\\nabandoned, meals and drinks </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">up to its faceplate, some kind of scope system scanning the dead\\nman’s features. On its back was a rifle, a pistol</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">a third of the killer’s head vanished, blown out by the AP\\nshell. It didn’t fall. It had no brain to destroy; </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">as the sickly emerald light filled the bunk room.  \\n  \\nThe walls were moving.  \\n  \\nInsectoid machines were </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">crawling over the bulkheads, along the ceiling, over\\nthe beds, over the fallen. They swarmed around the damaged </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">machine, chittering\\nbinary commands and responses to each other. Two more of the killers stood\\namongst the dead, </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">the first.\\n“Will you tell me?” the third queried. Nasham’s skin crawled at the sound of\\nthese abominate things. </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Worse than the carnage at their feet was the sense\\nof... of... _curiousity._ Of emotion. _It thinks,_ the young </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">swarmed through the room.\\nThey were coming up out of a hole in the floor. As Nasham watched a pair of\\narachnid </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">legs, each almost half the size of a man, extended out of the ground,\\nbracing themselves on the lip of the hole. A</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">stroking the nightmare machine’s head. It\\nlooked towards Nasham and though it had no mouth, he knew it was </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">smiling.\\n“Open fire!” he shouted. “Open fire!”  \\n  \\nThe killers were faster and five of Nasham’s squad went down</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">in their opening\\nsalvo. The beetle-things swept forward in a rush of clicking limbs, like water\\nbursting through </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">a dam. They swarmed over Ducan. He screamed, thrashing at\\nthem as they cut into his armour, dribbling molecular </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">acid into the openings\\nor dissolving the seals of his suit. His cries ended in a pathetic gargle as\\nhis vocal </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">cords melted. The massive spider fired, a bolt of plasma ripping\\nfrom its weapons and Ferosh suddenly ended at the</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">waist. “Fall back!” Nasham\\nshouted. Another flash and another flatline single screamed in his ears. “Run!\\nRun!”  </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\n  \\nHe had led thirteen men and women into the dormitories. Five of them came out\\nwith him.  \\n  \\nIt took two </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">pleadingly. Nasham almost\\nfelt sorry for her. Like many of Invida Station’s staff, she was a promising\\njunior </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">officer with a commendable record and excellent political acumen. Being\\npart of the command staff of a black-boxed</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">continue\\ntrying to open it. “Listen to me very carefully,” he said, forcing himself to\\nstay calm. It wasn’t easy.</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Hyros had pried open the control panel and was trying to\\noverride the lock-down, but he wasn’t getting anywhere. </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">mouth to offer a threadbare lie and then the\\nlights had gone out. In the few seconds it had taken for the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">emergency\\nlighting to come on, the corridor had suddenly been filled with the skittering\\ninsect-things.  \\n  </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\nGende – he had been one of Asea’s people – had shrieked, a cry far too high to\\nhave come from such a </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">barrel-chested man, as he had seen the monstrous things\\nfollowing the Scarabs and then he had made no noise at all</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">as his head\\nvanished with the crack of a hyper-velocity bullet. The gaggle of researchers\\nwith them had screamed </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">and fled, trying to outpace the chitinous tide. Yenop\\nhad tried to buy them some time, laying down a curtain of </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">fire with his\\ngrenade launcher. Something had leapt through the flames, burying ten talons\\ninto the Janissary’s </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">chest and ripping them free, armour that could stop all\\nbut the heaviest fire cut like paper. Another flatline </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">signal shrilled in\\nNasham’s ears. He’d lost count of how many he’d heard by now.  \\n  \\nOne of the researchers </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">fell, a crater in the back of his torso. His killer\\ndied next, three Janissaries gunning it down. A wash of heat </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">and light lit up\\nthe hallway as a flamethrower played over the walls and ceilings, burning the\\nclicking tide </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">back. The flame had stuttered and died as the tanks emptied.\\nSomeone was screaming, clutching at their face as </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">molecular acid burned away\\ntheir flesh, a cluster of stinging, biting Scarabs dropping from the ceiling,\\nbursting</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">out of air vents. The man collapsed, his cries ending as his vocal\\ncords dissolved.  \\n  \\nSomeone else was </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">shouting for reinforcements. It might even have been Nasham\\nhimself. His squad was urging the civilians and </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">unarmoured personnel through a\\nquarantine door, hustling them through by twos and threes. Eten was on the\\ncomm, </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">counting down to another quarantine purge.  \\n  \\nAsea was bellowing obscenities at her own people, urging them out</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">of the\\ncompromised section. A pair of Nasham’s squad were the rearguard, covering the\\nlast few stragglers. As the</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">last of Asea’s people dove through the doorway,\\nshe followed. She ran as Nasham’s soldiers died behind her, cut </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">down by the\\nStalkers, the abominate machines advancing past their victims. One of them was\\nstill writhing as the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Scarabs swarmed over him. Asea ran faster, a hail of\\nfire licking out from Nasham’s survivors as they covered her.</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">She ran towards\\nhim, exhausted and terrified and, as she drew closer, so close to escape –\\nthere was a hint of </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">victory...  \\n  \\n...and a single little machine darted its way through the fusillade, grabbed\\nonto the back of </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">her leg and turned on its cutting laser.  \\n  \\nNasham howled as he watched her fall, surging ahead of his troops </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">and firing\\ninto the horde indiscriminately. She was too far away and the machines were\\nmoving too fast. Asea </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">pulled herself to her feet and looked over her shoulder.\\nHer right leg was badly burned, the muscles cut. She </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">could barely walk.\\nRunning wasn’t an option. She turned back to Nasham and gestured for him to\\ngo, shouting at </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">him. He shook his head. He couldn’t.  \\n  \\nHe couldn’t leave her, but he also couldn’t save her.  \\n  \\nShe met </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">his gaze. He saw what she was going to do in the same instant she made\\nthe decision. Tears welled up in her eyes </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">as she turned away, hobbling towards\\nthe swarm.  \\n  \\nNasham shouted her name, surging towards her, but his men </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">held him back. His\\ngun cycled empty. He struggled, fought, cursed at his own squad as they\\ndragged him to safety,</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">hauling him through the doors.  \\n  \\nAsea tried to be brave, but her courage failed her at the last and </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">she\\nscreamed, thrashing as the machines swept over her. In a matter of seconds\\nNasham couldn’t even see her any </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">longer and just before the doors closed\\nbehind him, he saw the mound of swarming machines that had once been </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">a\\nvibrant, beautiful woman disperse into nothing.  \\n  \\nThe radiation purge activated and Invida Station </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">amputated another piece of\\nitself.  \\n  \\n~  \\n  \\n“Patron.”  \\n  \\n“Patron,” the voice called again. “Patron.”  </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\n  \\nFinally, he responded, lifting his head. “What?”  \\n  \\nRadan tilted her head. “You need to see this.”  \\n  </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\nSomehow, Nasham managed to rouse himself from his stupor. His throat hurt and\\nhis lips were dry. He didn’t know </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">how long he’d sat there, staring at nothing.\\nIt couldn’t have been very long. Or maybe it had; he’d lost track of </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">time.\\nHe’d long since stopped paying attention to the clock on his HUD. Seconds,\\nminutes and hours were all the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">same now.  \\n  \\nTheir escape had taken them into one of the high security areas of Invida.\\nNasham had never been </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">here before; his duties had involved securing the lower\\nlevels. Those were now overrun. As the machine horde had </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">poured through the\\nbreached wall, more and more of their diggers had burrowed their way into\\nInvida’s bunkers, </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">complexes and tunnel system. Anywhere other than the central\\ncore had been turned into a charnel house as lifeless</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">murderers stalked their\\nprey through pitch-blank corridors.  \\n  \\nAfter a moment, Nasham looked up at the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">convert. “What is it?”  \\n  \\nRadan bit her lip, running a hand through her stringy, sweat-soaked mane. “I\\ndon’t </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">know.”  \\n  \\nIt was a fair assessment, Nasham realized shortly. Radan led him to the area’s\\nstaff lounge. It was </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">only Nasham and a handful of his Janissaries present; the\\ncivilians they’d saved hadn’t been let in. With very </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">good reason; the\\nscientists that had worked here were all dead. As bad as it sounded, that\\nwouldn’t have been in </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">itself, a reason to spare the civilians this sight. No,\\nit was the manner in which they’d died. They’d been lined </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">up against one wall\\nand shot in the head. Very few of them were even recognizable. Verde looked up\\nas Nasham </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">entered the room, the Janissary holding up a hand. Identicards\\ndangled from his fist. “I checked the work roster,”</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">he said without preamble.\\n“Everyone who worked here is over there,” he nodded towards the row of\\ncorpses. “As far</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">I as can tell, at least.”  \\n  \\n“Did one of those things get in here?” another of Nasham’s squad asked. Anz,\\nhe </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">thought.  \\n  \\n“No,” the submissive said aloud, his voice raw. It hurt to speak. “A machine\\nwouldn’t have </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">bothered lining them up to kill them.” He knelt beside a female\\nThoughtful. “This was a Compact weapon. Point </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">seven-five caliber. Probably a\\nJanissary carbine.” He looked up. “Why?”  \\n  \\nVerde shared a glance with Radan </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">and the other squad members in the room. He\\nheld out a datapad. With a sudden unpleasant sensation curdling in his</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">belly,\\nNasham took it and thumbed the screen on.  \\n  \\n~  \\n  \\nCrusader Marsu died with his men. The enemy had </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">infiltrated the comm network\\nand when he tried to secure Invida Station’s computer core, his force walked\\ninto an</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">ambush. In a display of heroism worthy of remembrance, the crusader\\ntook the bulk of his mangled forces and threw </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">them into the enemy’s teeth,\\nbuying time for a single squad to break contact and cloister themselves in </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">the\\ncomputer core, setting the necessary charges. They collapsed the passageways\\nafter them, trapping themselves </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">inside, but preventing the enemy from reaching\\nthe core. By the time dedicated diggers arrived, Column Leader </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Prime Yiven\\ndetonated the charges and destroyed the colony’s main computer hub.  \\n  \\nThe quarantine purges ended</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">as a hostile infiltration team disabled the\\nhardware connections, following their sabotage up by flooding the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">section with\\nradiation to prevent repairs being made. The irony of the situation went\\nunnoticed.  \\n  \\nThere </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">were many unsung heroes in the last days of Invida Station’s existence,\\nmen and women who died to save their </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">comrades’ lives, assaults of such\\nferocity and dedication that the enemy’s advance was slowed, halted and in\\neven</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">pushed back in places. Ground was gained, fought over, lost and taken\\nagain as the butchery escalated, but the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">enemy’s forces were effectively\\ninfinite. Nothing less than complete destruction could stop one of the\\nmachines; </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">self-repair mechanisms and a steady stream of mechanical tenders\\nmeant that on several occasions, Compact forces </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">identified their opponents as\\nunits they had previously neutralized.  \\n  \\nFighting inside the colony became an </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">increasing hostile environment. Scarab\\nswarms and Spiders would cut through bulkheads and walls to open up </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">new\\navenues of attack. Drilling forms would do likewise, cutting through the\\nnetwork of tunnels to access sealed </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">portions of the station. Machines carrying\\ndemolition charges would blast or burn through sealed doors. Heavy </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">weapon\\nteams set up firepoints to isolate Compact units from each other. Infiltrators\\nfollowed comm signals, </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">preying on understrength squads and individual\\nsoldiers. Civilian casualties continued to mount as traditional </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">lines of\\ndefence meant little to the invading force. Reports of the hostiles attempting\\nto take high-ranking </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">personnel alive were unconfirmed. A claim from a security\\nforce witnessing a Janissary team shooting a captive </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">researcher dead was\\ndismissed as an unfortunate accident.  \\n  \\nIsolated from the main battlegrounds, Nasham led </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">R’kan squad through the\\nlaboratories. His blood was pounding in his head as they passed more scenes of\\nmurder. </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">More dead scientists and technicians. Like the others, these hadn’t\\nbeen killed in battle. They’d all been </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">executed. Most had been shot while\\nstanding; a few had been on their knees or lying on the ground as </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">their\\npreference, culture or religion dictated. Some had been shot in the back as\\nthey had tried to run.  \\n  </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\nComputer screens were smashed, work terminals were shot to pieces, flames\\ndanced and crackled amidst ruined </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">cybernetics laboratories. The destruction\\nhad been focused at first; targeting specific bits of research but </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">had\\ngraduated to full-on demolition of anything that looked even vaguely\\nimportant. Whoever had done this had </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">killed the last few groups of researchers\\nwithout realizing that now they didn’t know what physical devices needed</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">to be\\ndestroyed. Either they hadn’t cared, or hadn’t had the chance to do so. _I\\nsuppose the gunshots from the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">first groups you murdered unsettled the rest,\\nyes?_ Nasham thought sardonically.  \\n  \\n“This was going on while </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">we were fighting,” he said bitterly. “While we were\\ntrying to save these people, they were already dead.” He </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">traced one finger\\nthrough a pool of blood. It was still wet, only just now starting to dry. “I\\ndidn’t know we had</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Tier 5 protocols in place here.”  \\n  \\nThe other Janissaries shared a glance between each other. “You mentioned </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">that\\nafter the first room,” Radan said to her superior. They were talking on the\\nsquad’s channel to avoid </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">alarming the civilians; the scenes of slaughter had\\nput their charges on the verge of panic as it was. “What are </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">they?”  \\n  \\n“Something I shouldn’t even know about myself,” Nasham replied. He looked over\\nhis shoulder at his </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">handful of survivors. They were close; the scattered comm\\nintercepts R’kan was picking up were getting stronger </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">and more coherent. “But\\nyou have a powerful enough bloodline and you learn things outside your normal\\nduties. </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Threat Tier 5 protocols assume that something is too dangerous to be\\nallowed to exist, in any form. All traces of </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">it have to be wiped,” he held up\\nhis hand, watching trails of blood run along the angles of his gauntlet. </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">“All\\nrecords are destroyed. All personnel are terminated. Sufficiently valuable\\nindividuals may be mind-wiped for</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">their protection. Everything else is\\ndestroyed.” He chuckled. The sound was devoid of humour. “Yiven’s </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">cleaning\\nhouse.”  \\n  \\nHe stood with a purr of powered joints. “Of course, it’s not a real Tier 5\\nsituation, is </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">it? There are records. _Unmatchable Deed_ got out. Whoever\\nfounded this colony still exists. Whoever signed the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">orders,” he laughed\\nagain. It was even uglier than before. “I don’t think they’re going to get\\nscratched. Do you?</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">No, Yiven’s just... cleaning house.” He repeated, managing\\nto stop himself from saying anything else.  \\n  \\n“All </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">these people...” Anz said. “We were supposed to protect them.”  \\n  \\n“Up until they became a liability,” Verde </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">sneered. “Invida’s always been a\\nblack box and now they’re closing it up with us still inside.”  \\n  \\nThe </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Janissaries looked at him. Radan spoke, nervously running her fingers over\\nthe trigger guard of her grenade </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">launcher. “Then what do we do?”  \\n  \\n“What we always do,” Nasham replied. “Our duty.” He leaned over a small </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">map,\\nwiping a smattering of blood and ash away as he traced a utility hallway that\\nled deeper into the central </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">core, away from the scenes of ruin and slaughter.\\n“This should take us to secondary command.”  \\n  \\n“We’re not </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">pogrom,”\\nNasham shrugged. He looked over at his few survivors, military and civilian\\nboth. “It comes down to </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">where you want to die. Anyone who wants to stay here\\ncan, but I...” he paused, seeing Asea’s face before his eyes.</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">forces became\\nmore frequent and clear. The picture it painted was all too familiar. About\\ntwo-thirds of the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">surviving defenders had been trapped in the upper levels of\\nthe central core when it fell. They’d managed to </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">blockade the passages down\\ninto the lower core and were fighting to hold them against repeated and\\nintense </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">attack. Several sallies to re-take vital facilities and sections had\\nfailed but at least two of the forces sent </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">out were still operational, though\\nthey were being ground down steadily. All the buildings and personnel </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">outside\\nthe central core were assumed to be lost. No scouting teams had reported back\\nto indicate otherwise.  \\n </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\nAs Nasham led his squad towards the secondary command center, they picked up a\\nfew stragglers – wounded who’d </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">fallen behind, a fire team that had gotten\\nturned around in the chaos. By the time he reached the Compact lines he</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">had\\nalmost a full squad again.  \\n  \\nDespite a close call with the nervous gunners of a heavy weapon </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">our job.”  \\n  \\n“Yes it is,” Nasham said pointedly. “It most certainly is.”  \\n  \\nHe stepped closer to the </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">nametag.  \\n  \\nThe other man swallowed. “The column leader prime managed to get out of\\ncommand before it fell. </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">relay it for you, patron.”  \\n  \\n“No.” Nasham tapped Ket’s rank bars and then his own. “I will communicate </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">it\\ndirectly to the column leader prime.”  \\n  \\n“I-”  \\n  \\nThe group leader, submissive put his hand on the other</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">he strode into the command center, the rest of R’kan\\nfollowing him. Here and there he saw wounded soldiers slumped</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">against the\\nwalls, ratings and minor officers trying to coordinate the last, futile\\ndefence of Invida Station. </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">The room stunk of dust, ozone and blood. The\\nstation’s commander was leaning over a console, eyes intent on </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">whatever it\\nshowed. “Yiven,” Nasham raised his voice. Finally, the prime looked up. His\\neyes widened slightly as </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">he saw Nasham.  \\n  \\n“That is _column leader prime_ Yiven to you, submissive,” the older man said\\nthrough gritted</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">teeth.  \\n  \\n“If you were worthy of that rank, I’d address you by it,” Nasham said. He held\\nup the datapad, </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">tossing it to the prime. “That’s yours, I believe. I don’t\\nknow who actually carried it, but if they’re still </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">alive, I’d guess you’ve got\\nthem out on the front lines. Your executioners are going to be the first to\\ndie, </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">guards\\nmoved towards him, but the soldiers of R’kan held them back. “This place\\nshould have stayed dark and dead.</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">up and murdered.”  \\n  \\nA ripple of disbelief ran through the assembled personnel as they looked to\\neach other </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">and between Nasham and Yiven.  \\n  \\n“Yes,” the column leader admitted. “I did.”  \\n  \\n“When did it start? When </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">did you decide that we all had to die?” Nasham tapped\\nhis earpiece. “I’ve been listening to our people fall. </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\n“It was the only way,” Yiven said. “You don’t understand.”  \\n  \\n“You betrayed us,” Nasham accused. He wanted to</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">feel angry, he wanted to feel\\na surge of righteous fury at this revelation, but he couldn’t. Two days of\\nendless </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">the prime responded. There was a fervour in his eyes, an\\nunhealthy zealousness that made Nasham’s skin crawl. “We </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">were always going to\\ndie. Relief was never going to arrive in time. While you spread dissent and\\nsubversion, I </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">not only failed in that duty, you went out of\\nyour way to abrogate it, all for some damned secrets. Twenty </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">like this.” The gun shook in Nasham’s hands. Every flatline signal he’d\\nheard over the past two days rang in his </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">_Exactly_ like this,” Yiven was ranting. “You talk about the Articles of the\\nCompact, but I do what I do for the </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">by someone like you. _I did this for the\\nCompact,_ ” his hand dropped towards the pistol at his waist-  \\n  </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\\n-Nasham fired, each of the shotcannon’s three barrels speaking at once. Each slug put a hole the size of a </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">child’s fist in Yiven’s chest, and each of them created an exit wound the size of a man’s head in his back. The </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">prime toppled, his expression of righteous indignation still frozen on his face. “So did I,” Nasham said into the </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">to shoot him down. Somehow, that was the funniest thing in\\nthe world and he slumped into a chair and started </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">the\\none-way mirror. Group leader, submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy\\nwas still seated, resting his </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">forearms on the tabletop. The Shimmer bit her\\nlip. She’d interviewed Watchers with more animus to them. The </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">touch of grief or\\nanger had slipped into his words... but those emotions had faded away just as\\nquickly, washed </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">away and buried. She couldn’t blame him; not with what he’d\\ngone through. Not counting the Space Force personnel </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">of Invida Orbital and the\\npicket ships, 20,391 people had called Invida Station home. 20,390 of them\\nwere now </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">dead.  \\n  \\n“Yes,” Avun’et nodded. He looked to the flag officer. “If you wish, we can\\nschedule some </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">deep-regression interrogations.”  \\n  \\nHellv stroked the underside of his jaw. “No,” he said. “Those are </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">rarely\\neffective on Tribunes and I don’t believe the submissive is holding anything\\nvital back. We’ll try some </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">low-level recall procedures to get as much detail\\nas we can, but I don’t think anything more than that would be </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">useful.”  \\n  \\nThe Shimmer nodded. Standing beside the Thoughtful, the pair of them could –\\nat a quick glance – </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">almost be mistaken for father and daughter, the Thoughtful\\nalmost two feet taller than his partner. Both of them </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">had the same build, the\\nsame smooth, hairless skin – but more than a quick look would easily betray\\nLinnel’s </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">identity as a member of a client race. A wash of colour ran along her\\nskin as the Shimmer shifted her colouration </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">from the blues and greys of the\\nobservation room to the off-white of her partner’s skin. “And after?”  \\n  \\nThe </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">smiled then. “So we’re passing the decision\\ndown to our agents on the scene. You get all of the responsibility, </span>\n",
